Small individual projects as part of a Practical Machine Learning class

Assignment_1 deals with:
	* linear regression
	* K-neighbours classifier

Assignment_2 deals with:
	*Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier

Assignment_3 deals with:
	*K-means clustering

The final_project contains two parts:

	1. involves a two-layer perceptron
	2. involves a genetic algorithm implementation for a version of
 the Multiple Depot routing problem
