Small individual projects as part of a Practical Machine Learning class

Assignment_1 deals with:
	* linear regression
	* K-neighbours classifier

Assignment_2 deals with:
	*Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier

Assignment_3 deals with:
	*K-means clustering

The final_project contains two parts:

	Part 1. Consists of coding from scratch a two-layer perceptron. 
	Part 2. Consists of coding a genetic algorithm implementation for a version of
 the Multiple Depot routing problem
